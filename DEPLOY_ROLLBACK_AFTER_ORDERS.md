# Rollback snapshot after Orders modal change

Date: 2025-10-24

Branch: snapshot/after-orders-modal (created)

Purpose:
- Snapshot the repository state immediately after adding the Orders modal that shows order summary, product names and totals.

Notes:
- A prior snapshot exists in `snapshot/before-fixes` and `DEPLOY_ROLLBACK.md` (created earlier).
- To roll back to the state before this change, checkout `snapshot/before-fixes` or revert the commits on `fix/orders-ui`.

Suggested rollback commands (run from repo root):

```bash
git fetch origin
git checkout snapshot/before-fixes
``` 

Or to force the feature branch back to the before-fixes snapshot:

```bash
git checkout fix/orders-ui
git reset --hard origin/snapshot/before-fixes
git push --force origin fix/orders-ui
```

This file was created to make it explicit that a second snapshot exists after the Orders UI modal update.
